## Installation

<br>

## Configuration

From the extension's preferences, enter the terminal/shell commands to include in the drop-down menu and the associated display name for each command. If the name field is left empty, the command will not appear in the drop-down menu.

Tips:
- Run multiple commands by using `&` between commands.
- Chain multiple commands together to run one at a time using `&&` between commands.
- Test the full command first by running it in the terminal before adding it to the extension to verify it is correct. Note that because the command is not running in a terminal window, there will not be any output or error messages.
